/**
 * The picks in plain words. Wait is the seconds after a dictation of
 * `dictationSeconds`, on the benchmark GPU unless said otherwise. When
 * several languages were chosen, automatic switching is preferred, but a
 * usable manual model beats an automatic model over the error floor. Quality
 * is a hard constraint whenever any model stays under
 * `maxLanguageErrorPercent` on every chosen language. The overall pick has
 * the lowest error plus wait penalty, where the first `freeWaitSeconds` cost
 * nothing and each second beyond costs `waitWeight` points; its
 * `overallMaxWaitSeconds` limit relaxes before quality does. The fast pick is
 * judged on the benchmark CPU: the most accurate usable model within
 * `fastCpuMaxWaitSeconds`, else the quickest usable model. The most accurate
 * pick has the lowest error among usable models within
 * `accurateMaxWaitSeconds`, else the most accurate usable model. When no
 * usable model exists, the closest model carries every role. It remains
 * experimental below `experimentalMaxErrorPercent`, or when its lower
 * confidence bound reaches that cutoff; otherwise it is unsupported. A pick
 * that is usable but reaches `noteMinErrorPercent` on some chosen language is
 * still recommended, with the shortfall named rather than left to be
 * discovered: the usable band spans most of an order of magnitude, so silence
 * across all of it would say the same thing about very different models.
